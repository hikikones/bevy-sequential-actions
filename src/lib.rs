A [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) library that aims to execute a queue of various actions in a sequential manner.
This generally means that one action runs at a time, and when it is done,
the next action will start and so on until the queue is empty.

## 📜 Getting Started

#### Plugin

The quickest way for getting started is adding the [`SequentialActionsPlugin`] to your [`App`].

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_app::prelude::*;
use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
#
# struct DefaultPlugins;
# impl Plugin for DefaultPlugins { fn build(&self, _app: &mut App) {} }

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, SequentialActionsPlugin))
        .run();
}
```

#### Implementing an Action

An action is anything that implements the [`Action`] trait.
The trait contains various methods that together defines the _lifecycle_ of an action.
From this, you can create any action that can last as long as you like,
and do as much as you like.

An entity with actions is referred to as an `agent`.

A simple wait action follows.

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
#
# struct Time;
# impl Resource for Time {}
# impl Time { fn delta_seconds(&self) -> f32 { 0.0 } }
#
pub struct WaitAction {
    duration: f32, // Seconds
    current: Option<f32>, // None
}

impl Action for WaitAction {
    // By default, this method is called every frame in the Last schedule.
    fn is_finished(&self, agent: Entity, world: &World) -> bool {
        // Determine if wait timer has reached zero.
        world.get::<WaitTimer>(agent).unwrap().0 <= 0.0
    }

    // This method is called when an action is started.
    fn on_start(&mut self, agent: Entity, world: &mut World) -> bool {
        // Take current time (if paused), or use full duration.
        let duration = self.current.take().unwrap_or(self.duration);

        // Run the wait timer system on the agent.
        world.entity_mut(agent).insert(WaitTimer(duration));

        // Is action already finished?
        // Returning true here will immediately advance the action queue.
        self.is_finished(agent, world)
    }

    // This method is called when an action is stopped.
    fn on_stop(&mut self, agent: Option<Entity>, world: &mut World, reason: StopReason) {
        // Do nothing if agent has been despawned.
        let Some(agent) = agent else { return };

        // Take the wait timer component from the agent.
        let wait_timer = world.entity_mut(agent).take::<WaitTimer>();

        // Store current time when paused.
        if reason == StopReason::Paused {
            self.current = Some(wait_timer.unwrap().0);
        }
    }

    // Optional. This method is called when an action is added to the queue.
    fn on_add(&mut self, agent: Entity, world: &mut World) {}

    // Optional. This method is called when an action is removed from the queue.
    fn on_remove(&mut self, agent: Option<Entity>, world: &mut World) {}

    // Optional. The last method that is called with full ownership.
    fn on_drop(self: Box<Self>, agent: Option<Entity>, world: &mut World, reason: DropReason) {}
}

#[derive(Component)]
struct WaitTimer(f32);

fn wait_system(mut wait_timer_q: Query<&mut WaitTimer>, time: Res<Time>) {
    for mut wait_timer in &mut wait_timer_q {
        wait_timer.0 -= time.delta_seconds();
    }
}
```

#### Modifying Actions

Actions can be added to any [`Entity`] that contains the [`ActionsBundle`].
This is is done through the [`actions(agent)`](ActionsProxy::actions)
extension method implemented for both [`Commands`] and [`World`].
See the [`ModifyActions`] trait for available methods.

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_app::AppExit;
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
#
# struct EmptyAction;
# impl Action for EmptyAction {
#   fn is_finished(&self, _a: Entity, _w: &World) -> bool { true }
#   fn on_start(&mut self, _a: Entity, _w: &mut World) -> bool { true }
#   fn on_stop(&mut self, _a: Option<Entity>, _w: &mut World, _r: StopReason) {}
# }
#
fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
#   let action_a = EmptyAction;
#   let action_b = EmptyAction;
#   let action_c = EmptyAction;
#   let action_d = EmptyAction;
#
    // Spawn entity with the bundle
    let agent = commands.spawn(ActionsBundle::new()).id();
    commands
        .actions(agent)
        // Add a single action
        .add(action_a)
        // Add multiple actions
        .add_many(actions![
            action_b,
            action_c,
            action_d
        ])
        // Add an anonymous action with a closure
        .add(|_agent, world: &mut World| -> bool {
            // on_start
            world.send_event(AppExit::Success);
            true
        });
}
```

#### ⚠️ Warning

Since you are given a mutable [`World`], you can in practice do _anything_.
Depending on what you do, the logic for advancing the action queue might not work properly.
There are a few things you should keep in mind:

* If you want to despawn an `agent` as an action, this should be done in [`on_start`](`Action::on_start`).
* The [`execute`](`ModifyActions::execute`) and [`next`](`ModifyActions::next`) methods should not be used,
    as that will immediately advance the action queue while inside any of the trait methods.
    Instead, you should return `true` in [`on_start`](`Action::on_start`).
* When adding new actions, you should set the [`start`](`ModifyActions::start`) property to `false`.
    Otherwise, you will effectively call [`execute`](`ModifyActions::execute`) which, again, should not be used.

    ```rust,no_run
    # use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
    # use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
    # struct EmptyAction;
    # impl Action for EmptyAction {
    #   fn is_finished(&self, _a: Entity, _w: &World) -> bool { true }
    #   fn on_start(&mut self, _a: Entity, _w: &mut World) -> bool { true }
    #   fn on_stop(&mut self, _a: Option<Entity>, _w: &mut World, _r: StopReason) {}
    # }
    # struct TestAction;
    # impl Action for TestAction {
    #   fn is_finished(&self, _a: Entity, _w: &World) -> bool { true }
        fn on_start(&mut self, agent: Entity, world: &mut World) -> bool {
    #       let action_a = EmptyAction;
    #       let action_b = EmptyAction;
    #       let action_c = EmptyAction;
            world
                .actions(agent)
                .start(false) // Do not start next action
                .add_many(actions![action_a, action_b, action_c]);

            // Immediately advance the action queue
            true
        }
    #   fn on_stop(&mut self, _a: Option<Entity>, _w: &mut World, _r: StopReason) {}
    # }
    ```
