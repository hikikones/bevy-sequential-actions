A [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) library that aims to execute a queue of various actions in a sequential manner.
This generally means that one action runs at a time, and when it is done,
the next action will start and so on until the queue is empty.

## üìú Getting Started

#### Plugin

The quickest way for getting started is adding the [`SequentialActionsPlugin`] to your [`App`].

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_app::prelude::*;
use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
#
# struct DefaultPlugins;
# impl Plugin for DefaultPlugins { fn build(&self, _app: &mut App) {} }

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugins((DefaultPlugins, SequentialActionsPlugin))
        .run();
}
```

#### Implementing an Action

An action is anything that implements the [`Action`] trait.
The trait contains 3 required methods:

* [`is_finished`](Action::is_finished) to determine if an action is finished or not.
* [`on_start`](Action::on_start) which is called when an action is started.
* [`on_stop`](Action::on_stop) which is called when an action is stopped.

In addition, there are 3 optional methods:

* [`on_add`](Action::on_add) which is called when an action is added to the queue.
* [`on_remove`](Action::on_remove) which is called when an action is removed from the queue.
* [`on_drop`](Action::on_drop) which is the last method to be called with full ownership.

An entity with actions is referred to as an `agent`.

A simple wait action follows.

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
#
# struct Time;
# impl Resource for Time {}
# impl Time { fn delta_seconds(&self) -> f32 { 0.0 } }
#
pub struct WaitAction {
    duration: f32, // Seconds
    current: Option<f32>, // None
}

impl Action for WaitAction {
    fn is_finished(&self, agent: Entity, world: &World) -> bool {
        // Determine if wait timer has reached zero.
        // By default, this method is called every frame in the Last schedule.
        world.get::<WaitTimer>(agent).unwrap().0 <= 0.0
    }

    fn on_start(&mut self, agent: Entity, world: &mut World) -> bool {
        // Take current time (if paused), or use full duration.
        let duration = self.current.take().unwrap_or(self.duration);

        // Run the wait timer system on the agent.
        world.entity_mut(agent).insert(WaitTimer(duration));

        // Is action already finished?
        // Returning true here will immediately advance the action queue.
        self.is_finished(agent, world)
    }

    fn on_stop(&mut self, agent: Option<Entity>, world: &mut World, reason: StopReason) {
        // Do nothing if agent has been despawned.
        let Some(agent) = agent else { return };

        // Take the wait timer component from the agent.
        let wait_timer = world.entity_mut(agent).take::<WaitTimer>();

        // Store current time when paused.
        if reason == StopReason::Paused {
            self.current = Some(wait_timer.unwrap().0);
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Component)]
struct WaitTimer(f32);

fn wait_system(mut wait_timer_q: Query<&mut WaitTimer>, time: Res<Time>) {
    for mut wait_timer in &mut wait_timer_q {
        wait_timer.0 -= time.delta_seconds();
    }
}
```

#### Modifying Actions

Actions can be added to any [`Entity`] that contains the [`ActionsBundle`].
See the [`ModifyActionsExt`] trait for available methods.
The extension trait is implemented for both [`EntityCommands`] and [`EntityWorldMut`].

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
#
# struct EmptyAction;
# impl Action for EmptyAction {
#   fn is_finished(&self, _a: Entity, _w: &World) -> bool { true }
#   fn on_start(&mut self, _a: Entity, _w: &mut World) -> bool { true }
#   fn on_stop(&mut self, _a: Option<Entity>, _w: &mut World, _r: StopReason) {}
# }
#
fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
#   let action_a = EmptyAction;
#   let action_b = EmptyAction;
#   let action_c = EmptyAction;
#
    commands
        // Spawn entity with the bundle
        .spawn(ActionsBundle::new())
        // Add a single action
        .add_action(action_a)
        // Add multiple actions with a specified config
        .add_actions_with_config(
            AddConfig {
                start: true, // Start next action if nothing is currently running
                order: AddOrder::Back, // Add the action to the back of the queue
            },
            // Helper macro for creating an array of boxed actions
            actions![
                action_b,
                action_c
            ],
        )
        // Add an anonymous action with a closure
        .add_action(|_agent, world: &mut World| -> bool {
            // on_start
            true
        });
}
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

One thing to keep in mind is when modifying actions using [`World`] inside the [`Action`] trait.
In order to pass a mutable reference to world when calling the trait methods,
the action has to be temporarily removed from an `agent`.
This means that depending on what you do,
the logic for advancing the action queue might not work properly.

In general, there are two rules when modifying actions for an `agent` inside the action trait:

* When adding new actions, you should either set the [`start`](AddConfig::start) property in [`AddConfig`] to `false`,
    or push to the [`ActionQueue`] component directly.
* The [`execute_actions`](ModifyActionsExt::execute_actions) and [`next_action`](ModifyActionsExt::next_action) methods should not be used.
