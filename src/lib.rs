//! # Bevy Sequential Actions
//!
//! A [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) library
//! that aims to execute a list of various actions in a sequential manner.
//! This generally means that one action runs at a time, and when it is done,
//! the next action will start and so on until the list is empty.
//!
//! ## Getting Started
//!
//! An action is anything that implements the [`Action`] trait,
//! and can be added to any [`Entity`] that contains the [`ActionsBundle`].
//!
//! ```rust,no_run
//! # use bevy::prelude::*;
//! # use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
//! # use shared::actions::QuitAction;
//! #
//! fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
//! #   let wait_action = QuitAction;
//! #   let move_action = QuitAction;
//! #   let quit_action = QuitAction;
//! #
//!     // Create entity with ActionsBundle
//!     let entity = commands.spawn_bundle(ActionsBundle::default()).id();
//!     
//!     // Add a single action with default config
//!     commands.actions(entity).add(wait_action);
//!     
//!     // Add multiple actions with custom config
//!     commands
//!         .actions(entity)
//!         .config(AddConfig {
//!             // Add each action to the back of the queue
//!             order: AddOrder::Back,
//!             // Start the next action if nothing is currently running
//!             start: true,
//!             // Repeat the action
//!             repeat: Repeat::Amount(0),
//!         })
//!         .add(move_action)
//!         .add(quit_action);
//! }
//! ```
