A [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) library that aims to execute a queue of various actions in a sequential manner.
This generally means that one action runs at a time, and when it is done,
the next action will start and so on until the queue is empty.

## üìú Getting Started

#### Plugin

In order for everything to work, the [`SequentialActionsPlugin`] must be added to your [`App`](bevy_app::App).

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_app::prelude::*;
use bevy_sequential_actions::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugin(SequentialActionsPlugin::default())
        .run();
}
```

#### Modifying Actions

An action is anything that implements the [`Action`] trait,
and can be added to any [`Entity`] that contains the [`ActionsBundle`].
An entity with actions is referred to as an `agent`.
See the [`ModifyActions`] trait for available methods.

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
#
# struct EmptyAction;
# impl Action for EmptyAction {
#   fn is_finished(&self, _a: Entity, _w: &World) -> bool { true }
#   fn on_start(&mut self, _a: Entity, _w: &mut World) -> bool { true }
#   fn on_stop(&mut self, _a: Entity, _w: &mut World, _r: StopReason) {}
# }
#
fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
#   let action_a = EmptyAction;
#   let action_b = EmptyAction;
#   let action_c = EmptyAction;
#   let action_d = EmptyAction;
#
    let agent = commands.spawn(ActionsBundle::default()).id();
    commands
        .actions(agent)
        .add(action_a)
        .add_many(actions![
            action_b,
            action_c
        ])
        .order(AddOrder::Front)
        .add(action_d)
        // ...
#       ;
}
```

#### Implementing an Action

The [`Action`] trait contains 3 required methods:

* [`is_finished`](Action::is_finished) to determine if an action is finished or not.
* [`on_start`](Action::on_start) which is called when an action is started.
* [`on_stop`](Action::on_stop) which is called when an action is stopped.

In addition, there are 3 optional methods:

* [`on_add`](Action::on_add) which is called when an action is added to the queue.
* [`on_remove`](Action::on_remove) which is called when an action is removed from the queue.
* [`on_drop`](Action::on_drop) which is the last method to be called with full ownership.

A simple countdown action follows.

```rust,no_run
# use bevy_ecs::prelude::*;
# use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
#
pub struct CountdownAction {
    count: i32,
    current: Option<i32>,
}

impl Action for CountdownAction {
    fn is_finished(&self, agent: Entity, world: &World) -> bool {
        // Determine if countdown has reached zero.
        // By default, this method is called every frame in CoreSet::Last.
        world.get::<Countdown>(agent).unwrap().0 <= 0
    }

    fn on_start(&mut self, agent: Entity, world: &mut World) -> bool {
        // Take current count (if paused), or use full count.
        let count = self.current.take().unwrap_or(self.count);

        // Run the countdown system on the agent.
        world.entity_mut(agent).insert(Countdown(count));

        // Is action already finished?
        // Returning true here will immediately advance the action queue.
        self.is_finished(agent, world)
    }

    fn on_stop(&mut self, agent: Entity, world: &mut World, reason: StopReason) {
        // Take the countdown component from the agent.
        let countdown = world.entity_mut(agent).take::<Countdown>();

        // Store current count when paused.
        if let StopReason::Paused = reason {
            self.current = Some(countdown.unwrap().0);
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Component)]
struct Countdown(i32);

fn countdown_system(mut countdown_q: Query<&mut Countdown>) {
    for mut countdown in &mut countdown_q {
        countdown.0 -= 1;
    }
}
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

One thing to keep in mind is when modifying actions using [`World`] inside the [`Action`] trait.
In order to pass a mutable reference to world when calling the trait methods,
the action has to be temporarily removed from an `agent`.
This means that depending on what you do,
the logic for advancing the action queue might not work properly.

In general, there are two rules when modifying actions for an `agent` inside the action trait:

* When adding new actions, you should either set the [`start`](ModifyActions::start) property to `false`,
    or push to the [`ActionQueue`] component directly.
* The [`execute`](ModifyActions::execute) and [`next`](ModifyActions::next) methods should not be used.
