/// The trait that all actions must implement.
///
/// All actions must declare when they are done.
/// This is done by calling [`next`](ModifyActions::next)
/// from either [`ActionCommands`] or [`Commands`].
///
/// # Examples
///
/// #### Empty Action
///
/// An action that does nothing.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
/// #
/// # fn main() {}
/// #
/// struct EmptyAction;
///
/// impl Action for EmptyAction {
///     fn start(&mut self, entity: Entity, world: &mut World, commands: &mut ActionCommands) {
///         // Action is finished, issue next.
///         commands.actions(entity).next();
///     }
///
///     fn stop(&mut self, entity: Entity, world: &mut World) {}
/// }
/// ```
///
/// #### Wait Action
///
/// An action that waits a specified time in seconds.
///
/// ```rust
/// # use bevy::prelude::*;
/// # use bevy_sequential_actions::*;
/// # use shared::actions::QuitAction;
/// #
/// # fn main() {
/// #     App::new()
/// #         .add_plugins(MinimalPlugins)
/// #         .add_startup_system(setup)
/// #         .add_system(wait)
/// #         .run();
/// # }
/// #
/// # fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
/// #     let entity = commands.spawn_bundle(ActionsBundle::default()).id();
/// #     commands.actions(entity).add(WaitAction(0.0)).add(QuitAction);
/// # }
/// struct WaitAction(f32);
///
/// impl Action for WaitAction {
///     fn start(&mut self, entity: Entity, world: &mut World, _commands: &mut ActionCommands) {
///         world.entity_mut(entity).insert(Wait(self.0));
///     }
///
///     fn stop(&mut self, entity: Entity, world: &mut World) {
///         world.entity_mut(entity).remove::<Wait>();
///     }
/// }
///
/// #[derive(Component)]
/// struct Wait(f32);
///
/// fn wait(mut wait_q: Query<(Entity, &mut Wait)>, time: Res<Time>, mut commands: Commands) {
///     for (entity, mut wait) in wait_q.iter_mut() {
///         wait.0 -= time.delta_seconds();
///         if wait.0 <= 0.0 {
///             // Action is finished, issue next.
///             commands.actions(entity).next();
///         }
///     }
/// }
