- [Add downcasting for boxed actions][84]
- [Rework actions to be both more composable and simpler][83]
    - Adds four new methods to the `Action` trait:

        - `on_remove` which is called when an action is removed from the queue.
        - `on_drop` which is the last method to be called and gives full ownership.
    - Changes `Action::on_start` to now return a `bool` for immediate action queue advancement.
    - Removes `ActionCommands` struct for modifying actions inside the action trait.
    - Removes `ActionFinished` component.
    - Removes `Repeat` configuration.
    - Removes parallel and linked actions.
    - Removes tuple closure for anonymous actions with both `on_start` and `on_stop`.
    - Renames `add_sequential` to `add_many`.
    - Exposes the `ActionQueue` and `CurrentAction` components used by agents.
    - Exposes the `ActionHandler` struct that contains the system and methods used by this library.
