A [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org) library that aims to execute a queue of various actions in a sequential manner.
This generally means that one action runs at a time, and when it is done,
the next action will start and so on until the queue is empty.

## üìú Getting Started

#### Plugin

In order for everything to work, the `SequentialActionsPlugin` must be added to your `App`.

```rust
use bevy_sequential_actions::*;

fn main() {
    App::new()
        .add_plugin(SequentialActionsPlugin)
        .run();
}
```

#### Modifying Actions

An action is anything that implements the `Action` trait,
and can be added to any `Entity` that contains the `ActionsBundle`.
An entity with actions is referred to as an `agent`.
See the `ModifyActions` trait for available methods.

```rust
fn setup(mut commands: Commands) {
    let agent = commands.spawn(ActionsBundle::new()).id();
    commands
        .actions(agent)
        .add(action_a)
        .add_many(actions![
            action_b,
            action_c
        ])
        .order(AddOrder::Front)
        .add(action_d)
        // ...
}
```

#### Implementing an Action

The `Action` trait contains 3 required methods:

* `is_finished` to determine if an action is finished or not.
* `on_start` which is called when an action is started.
* `on_stop` which is called when an action is stopped.

In addition, there are 3 optional methods:

* `on_add` which is called when an action is added to the queue.
* `on_remove` which is called when an action is removed from the queue.
* `on_drop` which is the last method to be called with full ownership.

A simple wait action follows.

```rust
pub struct WaitAction {
    duration: f32, // Seconds
    current: Option<f32>, // None
}

impl Action for WaitAction {
    fn is_finished(&self, agent: Entity, world: &World) -> bool {
        // Determine if wait timer has reached zero.
        // By default, this method is called every frame in CoreSet::Last.
        world.get::<WaitTimer>(agent).unwrap().0 <= 0.0
    }

    fn on_start(&mut self, agent: Entity, world: &mut World) -> bool {
        // Take current time (if paused), or use full duration.
        let duration = self.current.take().unwrap_or(self.duration);

        // Run the wait timer system on the agent.
        world.entity_mut(agent).insert(WaitTimer(duration));

        // Is action already finished?
        // Returning true here will immediately advance the action queue.
        self.is_finished(agent, world)
    }

    fn on_stop(&mut self, agent: Entity, world: &mut World, reason: StopReason) {
        // Take the wait timer component from the agent.
        let wait_timer = world.entity_mut(agent).take::<WaitTimer>();

        // Store current time when paused.
        if reason == StopReason::Paused {
            self.current = Some(wait_timer.unwrap().0);
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Component)]
struct WaitTimer(f32);

fn wait_system(mut wait_timer_q: Query<&mut WaitTimer>, time: Res<Time>) {
    for mut wait_timer in &mut wait_timer_q {
        wait_timer.0 -= time.delta_seconds();
    }
}
```

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning

One thing to keep in mind is when modifying actions using `World` inside the `Action` trait.
In order to pass a mutable reference to world when calling the trait methods,
the action has to be temporarily removed from an `agent`.
This means that depending on what you do,
the logic for advancing the action queue might not work properly.

In general, there are two rules when modifying actions for an `agent` inside the action trait:

* When adding new actions, you should either set the `start` property to `false`,
    or push to the `ActionQueue` component directly.
* The `execute` and `next` methods should not be used.
